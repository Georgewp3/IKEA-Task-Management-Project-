This Project was created via the Replit application. The project contains 2 tabs:

Tab 1 has the admin view, where the admin adds user names and their details-and after adds tasks to each user.
Tab 2 has the user dashboard, where users choose their names, view their tasks and choose whether or not they completed their task before submitting the entry.

The admin tab contains a data bank, where the admin can view all the entries submitted and export them as an excel file (csv) if he wishes.
